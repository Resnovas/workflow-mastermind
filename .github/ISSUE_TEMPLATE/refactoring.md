**Describe the refactor**
Please briefly describe what part of the code base needs to be refactored.

**Improvements**
Explain the benefits of refactoring this code.

Transparent changes have the reasons for the change laid out clearly along with the change itself. This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning, which is less efficient. Avoid using terms such as "industry standard" or "best practices" as they are vague, opaque, and don't provide enough context as a reason for a change.

* Is there any missing test coverage which needs adding?

**Expected risks**
Please list features that can break because of this refactoring and how you intend to solve that.

* Is there any intended side effects?

**Involved components**
List files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
