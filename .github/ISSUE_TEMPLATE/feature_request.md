### Proposal

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

* Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?)


**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Intended users**
Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write "Unknown" and fill this field in later.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Permissions and Security**
What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users and groups as appropriate? Is the proposed behaviour consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?

**What does success look like, and how can we measure that?**
Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.
