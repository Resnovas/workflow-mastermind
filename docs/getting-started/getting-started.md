# Getting Started

#### Automatic installation

We have built a automatic installation system to ensure speed and simplicity. This installer will guide you through all the options of SCAA, and automatically install all dependencies, modules, templates and much more. 

Simply install our command-line interface using:

```bash
npm i -g @smartcloud/cli
```

Once installed, run the command

```bash
smartcloud install
```

#### Manual installation
