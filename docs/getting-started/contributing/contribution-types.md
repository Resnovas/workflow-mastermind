# Contribution Types

**For all contributions you are required to do the following**

1. Create your own fork of the latest development code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
   * Be sure to have commented the code so others can follow.
   * Be sure to have checked your using the latest API changes within your code.
   * Be sure to have named your project according to our versioning
   * Be sure to have included your CONT & PATCH information within the merge request \(see bellow\)
4. Send a merge request.
5. Await confirmation & Make any changes that Maintainers request
6. Get added to the list of contributors

**CONT**

Your username which you will be posting this contribution. it can be anything you want, as long as it identifies you. We prefer people to use their \[SCAA forum usernames\], but email addresses or github usernames work just as well.

**PATCH**

This patch is the version of YOUR code. It tracks how many changes you have made, and creates transparency for our community. This is especially important if its a new module or feature.

#### Minor Contributions <a id="minor"></a>

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a minor patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to �metadata� files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

#### Standard Contributions <a id="std"></a>

Standard contributions are contributions which are too large to be considered a minor contribution however, only address one feature or function. This can include, but is not limited to, tutorials, wiki pages, minor extension additions \(e.g. new command in the discord module\), new core feature \(e.g. small integrations\).

To make it really simple for users to submit these changes, we have written tutorials on how to modify each module our core team have developed.

\[Modifying SCAA Core\]   
\[Modifying SCAA Discord Module\]   
\[Create commands for the SCAA Discord Module\]

#### Major Contributions <a id="major"></a>

Major contributions are contributions which add, modify or remove multiple features or modules. We can not emphasise enough how much the community helps us every time they submit one of these.

Because we know how hard it is to get started from scratch, we have created a \[template module\] which can be forked and used as a starting point. We use Submodules to manage which modules are included within the production versions. This means that users can build modules as their own projects, managing and maintaining them externally.

To get you started on creating new SCAA Modules, checkout our guide.
