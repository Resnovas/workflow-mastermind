# Ground Rules

#### Contributor License Agreement

We have a Contributor License Agreement which can be found at the root of this project. It is required for [Standard Contributions](contribution-types.md#std) and [Major Contributions](contribution-types.md#major).

#### Responsibilities

* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: \[Code Requirements Checklist\]
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the core code unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions. \(Creating Classes for extensions is perfectly reasonable\)
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds

#### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Smart Cloud BMS? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

\[Beginner issues\] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

\[Help wanted issues\] - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Your first project?

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first!

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
