# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project.

This project uses the [Univeersal GitActions Workflows](https://github.com/TGTGamer/Universal-GitAction-Workflows) to automate our workflow, alongside provide templates for issues and pull requests. If you want to learn more about exactly what is included within the workflows, please checkout the documentation there.

## Why the guidelines

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and creating this project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. We created these guideleines to ensure that everyone has the same information when working on the project.

- Please don't use the issue tracker for support questions.
- Please check whether the FAQ or can help with your issue.
- Please check the closed tickets & pull requests before opening an new one.

## Contributor License Agreement

We have a Contributor License Agreement which can be found at [`{root}/docs/getting-started/contributing/agreement.md`](./AGREEMENT.md). It is required for [Standard Contributions](contribution-types.md#std) and [Major Contributions](contribution-types.md#major).

## Responsibilities

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
- Ensure that code meets all [requirements](contribution-types.md)
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Ensure each contribution is created on its own branch to ensure we can follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

- First Timers - issues specific for first time github users, designed and created to guide you through contributing.
- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

## Your first project

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first!

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge. Note that we do provide an automatic command for this which can be attempted through commenting `/rebase`.

## Creating a merge request

When you believe you have completed your contribution, you will need to make an pull request. This should be simple for most users, and we have provided some templates for you to get started, however if you choose to create your pull request from scratch, please ensure the following steps are followed.

### Titling your request

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format when creating pull requests, this is so we can squash all pull requests when merging and automatically create our changelog and releases. To ensure that this convention is completed, our automation will fail if the title does not follow this standard.

### Prefixes

If you are still working on your pull request, please ensure that you prefix it with `WIP:` to ensure that the pull isn't accidently merged before it's ready.

## Security Disclosures

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us.
