# Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly meeting that we hold in a public discord. The discord is announced in the weekly status updates. Notes are posted to the [TGT Media Ltd](https://tgtmedia.co.uk/) website and include a link to a YouTube recording of the meeting.

After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
